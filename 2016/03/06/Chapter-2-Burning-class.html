<p>Some other kids thought Mr Ehlics is tricking them and said “that&#8217;s no magic! horrible!”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>   When Mr Ehlics heard that, he stared at the kids and said “Just wait. You talk too early!”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>   The door smashed so hard and it was locked. The middle of the class, where he yawned, glowed purple, and a green leg was about to come out, when the bell ringed. Ms Zends were out side unlocking the door. The purple glowing and the green leg vanished and Mr Ehlics turned to the door with a little shock.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>   “The worst lesson ever!” I mumbled to Hover.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>   “Yeah, you&#8217;re right, but don&#8217;t say that loud. She might hear you.” Hover replied with a good advise.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>   “Thanks. To tell you the truth, I wanted to see what happens after that green leg comes out.” I mumbled while both of us were staring at Ms Zends.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>   “No, don&#8217;t say that. That might be a monster.” Hover was kind of scared when he said that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>   “How can it be a monster? Mr Ehlics is a teacher.” I replied with a smirk thinking it was a joke. “HeHe (Laughing).”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Get out of the room!” A greedy voice called “You two! Teachers!”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“What? Who’s that? Isn’t it the green leg guy?” A kid stood up and yelled. His legs were shaking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A shadow appeared behind the kid. It grew larger, and when I turned to the teachers, Ms Zends was there, but Mr Ehlics wasn’t there. I caught him walking down the front door stair case, when Hover was missing. I yelled for him, but he was still missing, until he mumbled to me that he’s under the table. I turned around to Mr Ehlics, but he was already walking down the road in front of the school. When I was about to ask Hover if he had some reason for Mr Ehlics to go so fast, I realised that the whole school was on fire, so Hover and I were finding some safe space, and tried to run out of the school, when a car smashed towards the wall. Hover and I smashed towards the car and the car window broke, and some how, we got to go in the car. When I rubbed my eyes and stood up, my mom, Simi Zinson,  was there driving the car. I was overjoyed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“We’re lucky, Kento. some young lady saved us.” Hover smiled.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“We’re not lucky! We’re scratched badly, and we’re covered with blood all over our body!” I replied with some anger thinking he was fooling around.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“Oh, by the way, who’s that young lady? You know her?” Hover asked curiously.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>“You should know by know. She’s my mother.” I said with a big smile “Simi Zinson.”</p>
