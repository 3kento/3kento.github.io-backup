<p>I’m Kento Zinson. I’m in the Singapore’s lolis Primary School. Hover is my best friend. He doesn’t have any parents and lives in a old spoiled refrigerator. I used to be a normal kid, before my teacher got into trouble.If you’re reading this because you think this is fiction, great, but if you think this is non-fiction and you feel something weird, quickly stop reading, and look out for danger. They might be waiting for you. And if you feel some thing weird thinking about this out side and you can’t stop thinking, they might be chasing you, so run away if you see any strange person. Hover dosn’t have any parents, and I don’t have my dad with me. When I was born, I didn’t see my dad.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>   I was in the first class at school. When I was at school having a normal science lesson,when the bell ringed, and my favourite teacher, Mr Ehlics came with 55 silver pens with a mark “Mr-E” on the left side of the pen, representing “Mr Ehlics”. He is the 70 years old martial arts teacher, but his weapons are not the normal weapons. It was time for martial arts. Every Friday, after my science lesson, I have martial art lesson.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>   “Today is Friday!” He whispered with a sad looking face.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>   I wondered why he had 55 pens. Usually, he comes with 56 pens. The 55 pens is for us and the other 1 pen is for him.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>   I mumbled to my best friend, Hover, while Mr Ehlics was putting down his pens on the table. “Why is he only carrying 55 pens?”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>   Hover replied with a smirk “How am I supposed to know? Maybe his gonna do something awesome this time.”</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>   Ancell, who was behind me heard and said “Shut up!” while the others were laughing at Mr Ehlics, thinking he forgot to bring 1 more pen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>   Ancell was a short ugly girl that behaved in front of the teacher and bullied small children, including Hover, When the teacher is not around I was angry at the other kids laughing and stood up and almost yelled, but Hover pulled me down and reminded me that I will have to answer some difficult question from Ms Zends, my worst night mare. I stared at the kids with my blood boiling. Then I rolled my eye away and tried to calm down. She is my tall strange looking math teacher, who had sharp eyes and she always had her eyes on me. I thanked Hover for reminding me, when My science teacher, Ms Frcis leaved the room with the annoying sound of her shoes. I don&#8217;t really know the days arrangement, but I know that it&#8217;s Friday when I hear the annoying sound, but she&#8217;s a bit kind. After Mr Ehlics put down his so called precious pens, Hover and I were looking carfully to his hands. He stood in the middle of the class and yawned. I was about to say "bless you!" when I felt weird. After the yawn, he got back to the table, and pointed his finger towards the middle of the class and it was silent for a minute.</p>
